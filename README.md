# xbmcnut's Home Assistant configuration
For now, until I can figure out how to get my entire config into Github safely and securely, my config files can be accessed through my [Wiki](https://github.com/xbmcnut/Hass.ioConfig/wiki "Pete's Wiki") along with some tips and tricks.

### Hardware
My Home Assistant installation now resides on an Intel NUC i5 which is more reliable than using any device that leverages an SD Card. If you are using an SD card, I highly encourage as your very first integration to add a [Google Drive Backup](https://github.com/sabeechen/hassio-google-drive-backup "Hass.io Google Drive Backup Add-on") for your installation files and set this to back up every day.

My MQTT Broker is running on my Synology NAS in a docker container along with a few other IoT components.
